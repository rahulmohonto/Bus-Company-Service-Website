                        It is always advisable to check reviews and referrals to hiring the best company. Your bus rental service should not be a random choice, so it is always important to do detailed research to select a good bus rental service.</p>

                        Make reservations</h4>
                    <p style={{ color: 'hotpink' }}>
                        With the onset of the festive season, you might want to plan things in advance. To ensure your trip does no get hampered, you may want to reserve at two months in advance and go ahead to confirm the reservations a week before the D-day. Usually, weddings and other special occasions are held during weekends or holidays, and this is the time reservations are a bit tricky to make because everyone else is looking to make their event a success.</p>

                <p style={{ color: 'hotpink' }}>
                    On the plus side you have a very good engine. The 345 seems to be the holy grail of the IHC engines for guys running Scouts and the trails and I can't disagree with their reputation as being stout performers. Every one I've ever seen has had a forged crank, forged rods, etc. They really are built well, but as you learned....they have a relatively low redline. My suggestion would be to rebuild what you have. Chances are you will only need to bore it (or even just hone it if you're lucky) and put some new gaskets, pistons, and rings in it. Though it's not cheap, it is easily your cheapest option short of running a used motor you pull out of some other vehicle.

                    The two speed rear end is of course a good option though might be expensive. Another option might be finding an aux. tranny. A final option if you really want to get frisky might be to take a divorced type rockwell transfer case and run it backwards so that low range is now a huge overdrive. I know it sounds kind of booty fab, but I've seen worse done for cheaper with god results
